# zpy_ui
 Hotkeys and tweaks around Blender's UI.
 Hotkeys defined here in addon instead of in Blender user preferences, to
    1) Not show keymaps as being "altered" when using my personal preference of defaults
    2) Override system default keys by placing my preferred keys above them
    3) Make it easier to find key changes and update them when a change occurs in Blender's source
